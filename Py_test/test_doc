# these are three rules that pytest must follow and identify this as a pytest case

#Any py test file should start with test_
#any code of the pytest showld we wrapped in method
#method name showld start with test



# click on folder file in top
# click edit configuration
# click on pytest
# click on source file of the pytest

# to run a pytest in cmd_prompt  py.test -v

-s is used to print the pytest prints
-v is used to see a full detail

# if yu want to run a sepcific file
# py.test test_demo2.py


what if we want to run a file with method with ending with creditcard for example

py.test -k creditcard -v -s

Part                            | Meaning
py.test / pytest                | Invokes the pytest test runner
-k creditcard                   | # pytest -k creditcard -v -s
-v | Verbose mode:              Shows the full names of tests and their statuses
-s | Don't capture output:      Allows you to see print() statements in terminal


 # pytest -k creditcard -v -s

mark
pytest -m smoke
to run a smoke mark


fixtures dont need to start with test_
fixture is like a prerequiste    

# fixture is nothing but pre conditions and post condition
# fixture is also help to load the data

 to take a report in html
