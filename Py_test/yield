yield is a keyword in Python, similar to return.

But unlike return, which terminates a function immediately,

yield pauses the function saving its state and allows resumption later.

def simple_return():
    return 1
    return 2  # unreachable

def simple_yield():
    yield 1
    yield 2

# Using return
print(simple_return())   # Output: 1

# Using yield
gen = simple_yield()
print(next(gen))         # Output: 1
print(next(gen))         # Output: 2
